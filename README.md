# Overview
The program is a password manager. It has the capability to store, retrieve, and delete information from and to a JSON file. 
It also encrypts the passwords, so the only way to access to them is through the program.
It checks for a master password, that grants or denies access to the rest of the features.

The purpose of writing this software was to practice and increase my knowledge of kotlin. 
The motivation for a password manager was that some apps that I used has complicated interfaces.

# Development Environment
To write the software I used IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE. It automatically installs the support for Kotlin.
I also reviewed different websites to read about syntax and rules of this programming language (listed below)

The Kotlin language is an object-oriented language that is used for general application development including Android mobile app development. 
It is based on the Java language. Kotlin was designed to provide improvements to the Java language while still supporting the Java libraries. 
Library support includes data structures, file operations, and networking.
